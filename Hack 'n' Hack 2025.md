## Problem Statement
At Aberbean University, engagement in tutorial/workshop classes is low. Students often do not complete their assigned work, and since tutorial problems are distributed as PDFs, instructors have no visibility into student progress or struggles. Without an interactive system, students lack motivation, and educators cannot provide targeted support.

## Potential Solution
A web-based platform where students can log their progress on tutorial problems, receive hints or explanations, and get incentives for participation. Instructors can monitor engagement and adjust their teaching accordingly.

(note: you are encourage to think of alternative solutions)
